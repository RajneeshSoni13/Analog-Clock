Analog Clock
A simple and elegant Analog Clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to use CSS for layout and design, and JavaScript for real-time functionality by accessing the system time.


ðŸš€ Features
Real-time display of hours, minutes, and seconds

Smooth hand movement with accurate time updates

Fully responsive design for various screen sizes

Minimalist and clean user interface






ðŸ’» Technologies Used
HTML â€“ Structure of the clock

CSS â€“ Styling and positioning of clock hands and face

JavaScript â€“ Logic to rotate hands based on current time


ðŸ§  How it Works
The clock face is created using div elements styled with CSS.

JavaScript accesses the current system time using Date() object.

The rotation of each hand (hour, minute, second) is calculated and updated every second using setInterval().
